<pre style="overflow: auto;">	There's a game that I used to play but have recently fallen out of love with called Magic: The
Gathering. I wanted to focus particularly on some of my favorite ways the game has portrayed 
Necromancy. The definition of "Necromancy" as a word can vary across time and place. The 
ancient Greeks used  the word to refer specifically to contacting the dead for information, usually so
it could be exorcised. The exorcists that performed these rites to lay spirits to rest were called 
psychag≈çgoi "ghost evocators" (Ogdan, pg 98-101). The Medieval Christian world used 
"Necromancy" to talk about almost any type of magic as, but it was usually applied to the 
summoning of demons (Esoterica, Sledge). Modern fiction usually uses the word to refer to any 
type of magic that involves death, with the specifics varying from case to case.
