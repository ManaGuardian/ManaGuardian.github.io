<pre>	There's a game that I used to play but have recently fallen out of love with called Magic: The
Gathering. I wanted to focus particularly on some of my favorite ways the game has portrayed 
Necromancy. The definition of "Necromancy" as a word can vary across time and place. The 
ancient Greeks used  the word to refer specifically to contacting the dead for information, usually so
it could be exorcised. The exorcists that performed these rites to lay spirits to rest were called 
psychag≈çgoi "ghost evocators" (Ogdan, pg 98-101). The Medieval Christian world used 
"Necromancy" to talk about almost any type of magic as, but it was usually applied to the 
summoning of demons (Esoterica, Sledge). Modern fiction usually uses the word to refer to any 
type of magic that involves death, with the specifics varying from case to case.

	The consistent throughline between these different views is the negative connotations of 
Necromancy. Many ancient Greek writiers chose to distance Necromancy's origin by claiming that 
the rituals originated from Persia, Babylonia, or Egypt, with there being little evidence that Greek 
Necromancy came from external cultures (Ogdan, page 132-140). The Catholic church at best 
tolerated Necromancy, because of how it was inextricably linked with exorcism, but would later ban
these exorcist manuals in the 16th to 17th century (Esoterica, Sledge). Most modern fiction inherits a
form of this same view and associates it primarily with liches and evil sorcerors.

	Magic: The Gathering mostly falls in line with this view in its portrayals. Such as the 
Orzhov Syndicate that shackle and enslave the souls of people in debt to them even after death. 
However, there are also examples of more nuanced portrayals. Such as the Abzan a faction that 
preserves the spirits and knowledge of their ancestors. Resurrection magic varies in weather it has 
positive or negative associations, but for this essay I'll be considering it as part of Necromancy since
it tends to be a defining aspect in modern depictions. In the context of Magic: The Gathering the 
group I'll be focusing on is the Golgari Swarm. They're a group that uses resurrection magic 
frequently on their members.
