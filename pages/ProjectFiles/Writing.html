		<h3>The Fae's Forest</h3>
		<!--Image if able-->
		<p>
		A piece of micro-fiction I wrote as part of a self-imposed challenge in February 2024.</br>
		I wanted to see if I could write four short stories in a month and failed. This came out of it,</br>
		and I'm proud enough of it to want to share it. Although, it does feel a little emotionally muted looking at it now.</br>

		<h3>An Essay on Death</h3>
		<!--Image if able-->
		<p>
		A one page essay I wrote in the character of Necromancer about the ethics of his craft.</br>
		It was part of a small scale writing competition, for a group that will remain nameless. I wanted to show off his character, but also present an alternative view of Necromancy.</br>
		Some of it hasn't aged as well, or just won't make much sense if you're not familiar with the larger setting he's a part of.</br>

		<h3>The Immortality of Necromancy</h3>
		<!--Image if able-->
		<p>
		An essay wrote as a sort of response to the one above, at least initially.
		It would proegressively become more about me talking about my favorite depictions
		of Necromancy. Until it took the form you see now, with a specific focus on Magic: The Gathering.
		Making it kind of a discount <a href="https://www.rhysticstudies.com/">Rhystic Studies</a> essay.</br>
		Actually, it's more like a discount <a href="https://linktr.ee/spice8rack">Spice 8 Rack</a> essay.</br>
