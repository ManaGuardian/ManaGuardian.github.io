		<h3>An Essay on Death</h3>
		<!--Image if able-->
		<p>
		An essay I wrote in the character of Necromancer about the ethics of his craft. It was part of
		a small scale writing competition, for a group that will remain nameless. I wanted to show off his character,</br>
		but also present an alternative view of Necromancy. Some of it hasn't aged as well, or just won't make</br>
		much sense if you're not familiar with the larger setting he's a part of.</br>

		<h3>The Immortality of Necromancy</h3>
		<!--Image if able-->
		<p>
		An essay wrote as a sort of response to the one above, at least initially.
		It would proegressively become more about me talking about my favorite depictions
		of Necromancy. Until it took the form you see now, with a specific focus on Magic: The Gathering.
		Making it kind of a discount <a href="https://www.rhysticstudies.com/">Rhystic Studies</a> essay.</br>
